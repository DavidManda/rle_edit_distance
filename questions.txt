Combine: why do we do inorder traversal as opposed to search for the segment?

On gradient change, the y coordinate of an empty segment should still be modified so the functions
 is continous

 In the cen and chao paper, the translation to graphical representation omits some points and makes sure there
 are no neighbouring segments with the same gradient. We might have to do the same here.

 The number of collapsing segments could be arbitratily large?
