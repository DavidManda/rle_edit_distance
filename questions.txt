Combine: why do we do inorder traversal as opposed to search for the segment?

Propagation SWM - why are all nodes in the subtree of v of types DF and FD or of types IF and FI.

The paper claims that whenever a node type changes, this change needs to be reflected at both
incident segments as the node is stored in two places. However, since the update comes from the 
root and will affect all children, all turning points will be correctly changed when the propagation
reaches them. I believe updating each point individually suffices.

Why is tmin access only when the node is inactive? shouldn't it be the other way around?
